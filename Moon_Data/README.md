## Project Overview

Building and deploying a custom model in SageMaker - specifically, defining and training a custom, PyTorch neural network to create a binary classifier for data that is separated into two classes; the data looks like two moon shapes when it is displayed, and is often referred to as **moon data**.

---

### Notebook Outline
The notebook will be broken down into a few steps:
1. Generating the moon data
2. Loading it into an S3 bucket
3. Defining a PyTorch binary classifier
4. Completing a training script
5. Training and deploying the custom model
6. Evaluating its performance
