# Predict Stock Prices

This repository contains code and associated files for deploying a stock price predictor using AWS SageMaker.

## Project Overview

In this project, the aim is to build a stock price predictor that examines the historic stock dataset for a publicly listed company and performs learning of various factors that affect the stock and allows prediction of future stock closing values. Predicting time-dependent data, referred to as time-series forecasting, is an active area of research; the task is non-trivial as many factors involved in the prediction: physical factors vs. physhological, rational and irrational behaviour, etc., make share prices volatile and very difficult to predict with a high degree of accuracy.
